# Day 1 - Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation, and Variables

- Here Iam using Anaconda for python and jupyter notebook for code editor.


> Printing
```sh
    print("Day 1 - Python")
```
> Commenting
```sh
    #print("Day 1 - Python")
```
> String Manipulation
```sh
    print("Day 1 - Python" + "Github")
```
> Input Function
```sh
   print("git clone" + " " + input("Enter your repositories: "))
```
> Python Variables
- In this section using python variables
- Below the example program
- using input() function for get input by user
- that input will stored in name(variable)
- Now user input will stored in name(variable)
- Print(name) now we see the ouput as user given input

```sh
   name = input("what is your name: ")
   print(name)
```
> Naming Variables

- Rule for naming variables
1. Make your code readable
2. Don't use python keywords for variable eg(False, await, else, import, pass, None, break, except, in, raise, True, class, finally, is, return, and, continue, for, lambda, try, as, def, from, nonlocal, while, assert, del, global, not, with, async, elif, if, or, yield)
3. A variable along with an keyword is suitable(eg: isname or is_name)

```sh
user_name = input("What is your name")
length1 = len(name)
print(length)
```
