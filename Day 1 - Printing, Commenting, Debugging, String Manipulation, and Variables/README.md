# Day 1 - Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation, and Variables

- Here Iam using Anaconda for python and jupyter notebook for code editor.


> Printing
```python
    print("Day 1 - Python")
```
> Commenting
```python
    #print("Day 1 - Python")
```
> String Manipulation
```python
    print("Day 1 - Python" + "Github")
```
> Input Function
```python
   print("git clone" + " " + input("Enter your repositories: "))
```
> Python Variables
- In this section using python variables
- Below the example program
- using input() function for get input by user
- that input will stored in name(variable)
- Now user input will stored in name(variable)
- Print(name) now we see the ouput as user given input

```python
   name = input("what is your name: ")
   print(name)
```
> Naming Variables

- Rule for naming variables
1. Make your code readable
2. Don't use python keywords for variable
3. A variable along with an keyword is suitable(eg: isname or is_name)

|**Keywords** |          |          |                                                      
|-------------|:--------:|---------:|   
| False       | await    | else     |
| import      | pass     | None     |
| break       | except   | in       |
| raise       | True     | class    |
| finally     | is       | return   |
| and         | continue | for      |
| lambda      | try      | as       |
| def         | from     | nonlocal |
| while       | assert   | del      |
| global      | not      | with     |
| async       | elif     | if       |
| or          | yield    |          |

```python
user_name = input("What is your name")
length1 = len(name)
print(length)
```
